# CODEWAY_TASK_4_SPAM_SMS_DETECTION

This project aims to develop an AI model capable of classifying SMS messages as either spam or legitimate. Leveraging techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings in conjunction with classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines, the model offers an effective solution for identifying spam messages, thereby enhancing user experience and security in SMS communication.
